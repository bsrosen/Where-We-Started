  Hey SweetHeart, I made this site to document and safe keep memories, gifts, and anything else, plus I wanted you to know how much
  you truely mean to me! I will be expanding on this site throughout time to add more to it, 
  so as we expand, this will expand with us,
  I seriously think you are the most comforting, safe, cute, nice, loving soul I have met, and I hope we can go down this path of growth
  together. <br> - Love, Brandon Scott Rosen
